# BTC1855_Midterm_2024
Midterm Assignment for BTC1855H

## Project plan

#### Surface Level Analysis
I will look at the data, identify the columns in each data set, identify formats, any issues/missing values within the data (etc.)

#### Data Cleaning
Create function(s) which cleans the data, deals with missing values, inconsistent units/formats etc. Using the guidelines given in the instructions I will exclude missing trips, identify outliers etc.


#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I will use the funModeling package to complete an exploratory data analysis on the trip and weather data. The steps outlined at: https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/exploratory-data-analysis-in-r-intro/ will be used as a starting point, any changes or additions made to the EDA will be documented in the report

##### Temporal Analysis

###### Identify rush hour/weekend traffic
Do an exploratory analysis to identify which hours of the weekdays contain the highest number of trips. Once this is identified I will determine the 10 most frequent starting stations. I can also identify the 10 most frequent starting stations during the weekend, monthly utilization of bikes


###### Weather Analysis
I will create a new dataset which encompasses both the trip and weather data, and create a correlation matrix, then flag the highest correlations
